  description: "**API Version**: 1.7\n\n**Date**: 9th July, 2024\n\n## 📄 Getting\
    \ Started\n\nThis API is based on the REST API architecture, allowing the user\
    \ to easily manage their data with this resource-based approach.\n\nEvery API\
    \ call is established on which specific request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\
    \ will be used.\n\nThe API must not be abused and should be used within acceptable\
    \ limits.\n\nTo start using this API, you will need not create or access an existing\
    \ Segnivo account to obtain your API key ([retrievable from your account settings](https://messaging.segnivo.com/account/api)).\n\
    \n- You must use a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints.\n    \n\
    - The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via\
    \ HTTP return an HTTP 301 redirect to the corresponding HTTPS resources.\n   \
    \ \n- The API returns request responses in JSON format. When an API request returns\
    \ an error, it is sent in the JSON response as an error key or with details in\
    \ the message key.\n    \n\n### 🔖 **Need some help?**\n\nIn case you have questions\
    \ or need clarity with interacting with some endpoints feel free to create a support\
    \ ticket on your account or you can send an email ([<i>developers@segnivo.com</i>](https://mailto:developers@segnivo.com))\
    \ directly and we would be happy to help.\n\n---\n\n## Authentication\n\nAs noted\
    \ earlier, this API uses API keys for authentication. You can generate a Segnivo\
    \ API key in the [API](https://messaging.segnivo.com/account/api) section of your\
    \ account settings.\n\nYou must include an API key in each request to this API\
    \ with the `X-API-KEY` request header.\n\n### Authentication error response\n\n\
    If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP 401\
    \ Unauthorized response code.\n\n## Rate and usage limits\n\nAPI access rate limits\
    \ apply on a per-API endpoint basis in unit time. The limit is 10k requests per\
    \ hour for most endpoints and 1m requests per hour for transactional/relay email-sending\
    \ endpoints. Also, depending on your plan, you may have usage limits. If you exceed\
    \ either limit, your request will return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status\
    \ code or HTTP 403 if sending credits have been exhausted.\n\n### 503 response\n\
    \nAn HTTP `503` response from our servers may indicate there is an unexpected\
    \ spike in API access traffic, while this rarely happens, we ensure the server\
    \ is usually operational within the next two to five minutes. If the outage persists\
    \ or you receive any other form of an HTTP `5XX` error, contact support ([<i>developers@segnivo.com</i>](https://mailto:developers@segnivo.com)).\n\
    \n### Request headers\n\nTo make a successful request, some or all of the following\
    \ headers must be passed with the request.\n\n| **Header** | **Description** |\n\
    | --- | --- |\n| Content-Type | Required and should be `application/json` in most\
    \ cases. |\n| Accept | Required and should be `application/json` in most cases\
    \ |\n| Content-Length | Required for `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests containing\
    \ a request body. The value must be the number of bytes rather than the number\
    \ of characters in the request body. |\n| X-API-KEY | Required. Specifies the\
    \ API key used for authorization. |\n\n##### 🔖 Note with example requests and\
    \ code snippets\n\nIf/when you use the code snippets used as example requests,\
    \ remember to calculate and add the `Content-Length` header. Some request libraries,\
    \ frameworks, and tools automatically add this header for you while a few do not.\
    \ Kindly check and ensure yours does or add it yourself."

- description: "The `/relay` endpoints lets you send/fetch marketing and transactional\
    \ emails from your `Segnivo Messaging` account.\n\nEmail messages sent through\
    \ these endpoints are categorized into two:\n\n- **Marketing Emails** - These\
    \ are emails sent for marketing or promotional purposes.\n    \n- **Transactional\
    \ Emails** - These are emails sent as a result of user actions or requests, they\
    \ usually take the form of notifications or One-Time-Passwords (OTPs), e.g. password\
    \ reset requests.\n    \n\nBy default, emails sent through these endpoints are\
    \ set as marketing emails except when marked as transactional with the **`is_transactional`**\
    \ attribute.\n\nSending a marketing email through these endpoints consumes **1\
    \ sending credit** on your account _if the email is sent successfully_.\n\nAlso,\
    \ based on our current pricing structure, sending 1 marketing email equals sending\
    \ 5 transactional emails; thus, **1 transactional email consumes 0.2 sending credit**\
    \ on your account.\n\nIn addition, bounced emails consume credits, i.e., once\
    \ an email is sent successfully, 1 sending credit will be deducted even if the\
    \ email is bounced/rejected by the recipient's MX server.\n\n#### 🔖 Domain Verification,\
    \ DKIM Signatures, and Spam\n\nBefore sending your first email, we highly recommend\
    \ you [add and verify](https://messaging.segnivo.com/sending_domains) your **sending\
    \ domain** in your `Segnivo Messaging` account, i.e., the domain of the **`from_email`**\
    \ from which your emails will come. For example, if you would be sending emails\
    \ from [support@example.com](https://mailto:support@example.com), example.com\
    \ should be added and verified as a sending domain.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/cd8a6847-5d05-4c0f-87b4-4bab99d4196d/c2QtdmVyaWZ5LTEucG5n\"\
    >\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/bee0dcde-523b-439c-bd5d-c1d1de1ac6f6/c2QtdmVyaWZ5LnBuZw==\"\
    >\n\nAdding a sending domain helps achieve and/or prevent the following:\n\n1.\
    \ When a request is received from the `/relay` endpoints, we detect the domain\
    \ in the **`from_email`** of the request, if the domain is added and verified\
    \ on your `Segnivo Messaging` account, we sign/attach a DKIM signature using the\
    \ verified sending domain.\n    \n2. If the domain has not been added or has not\
    \ been verified on your account, we will attach a DKIM signature using a domain\
    \ in our pool of domains which we use for every other user.\n    \n3. If you wish\
    \ to use Segnivo as a [Smart host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_host) for\
    \ just relaying messages and do not want us to sign and attach a DKIM signature\
    \ to your email, whether you have verified the sending domain or not, set the\
    \ **`sign_dkim`** value in your requests to `false`.\n    \n\n#### **Emails Landing\
    \ In Spam Folder or Getting Bounced/Rejected**\n\nThere is a high chance that\
    \ your emails will land in the spam folder or even worse get rejected (especially\
    \ for Yahoo and Gmail destinations) if you do not [add and verify your sending\
    \ domain](https://messaging.segnivo.com/sending_domains). Adding and verifying\
    \ your sending domain ensures that your emails are fully compliant with [SPF](https://resources.segnivo.com/glossary/spf/),\
    \ [DKIM](https://resources.segnivo.com/glossary/dkim/), [DMARC](https://resources.segnivo.com/glossary/dmarc/),\
    \ and [Return-Path](https://resources.segnivo.com/glossary/return-path/) alignments.\
    \ Also, we may throttle and place significant hourly API request limits on your\
    \ account if your domain is not verified.\n\nIn addition, if your sending domain\
    \ is newly registered (less than 3 weeks old), we recommend you keep your sending\
    \ volume low as most destinations, especially Gmail and Yahoo will reject/throttle\
    \ the delivery of your messages to protect their users from spam.\n\n#### **Webhook\
    \ Notifications**\n\nIf you wish to receive webhook notifications for your emails\
    \ please set up the delivery URL, secret key and the `events` for you which you\
    \ want to be notified in your [developer dashboard](https://messaging.segnivo.com/developers).\n\
    \nA `POST` request would be made to your delivery URL with the event data and\
    \ an `x-segnivo-signature` header which you can use to verify that the delivery\
    \ came from us. The signature is a `sha256` hash of the `email_id` and `message_id`\
    \ in the payload body, and the webhook signing key you provided in your developer\
    \ dashboard all concatenated in that order (email_id + message_id + signing key).\n\
    \nYou may choose to receive notifications for the following events; `sent`, `click`,\
    \ `open`, `failed`, and `bounced`.\n\nBelow is a sample webhook notification payload\
    \ for an email click event.\n\n`{`\n\n`\"event\":` `\"email.click\",`\n\n`\"event_id\"\
    : 12325,`\n\n`\"email_id\": 12379,`\n\n`\"email_uid\": \"66a6591a9e09f\",`\n\n\
